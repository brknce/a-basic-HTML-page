    <h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>
    <p>Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with <a href="http://supertech.mit.edu/">Charles
            Leiserson</a>, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/">Ron Rivest</a>, and <a
            href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a>. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a
        post on their blog about <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the secret to
            writing a best-selling textbook</a>.</p>
    <p>Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available?</i></dt>
        <dd>The fourth edition is in production. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering whether to
            hold off buying the third edition in anticipation of the fourth edition, all I can tell you is that the
            fourth edition will not be available in 2021.</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>Where is the website for the book?</i></dt>
        <dd>The MIT Press site is <a
                href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms</a>.
        </dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i></dt>
        <dd>
            We maintain an <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a> that allows
            you
            to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental update feature,
            allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.
            <p>We stopped logging errors January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.</p>
        </dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>How do I report errors?</i></dt>
        <dd>First, please visit the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a> to
            verify that the error has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an
            unreported
            error, send email to <a href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>. We will respond as quickly as
            possible, often within a day.</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>Do you correct errors?</i></dt>
        <dd>Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by
            that
            time. The <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a> indicates in
            which
            printing each error was corrected.</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i></dt>
        <dd>Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of Introduction to Algorithms was published
            in
            1990, the second edition came out in 2001, and the third edition appeared in 2009. A printing for a given
            edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the previous question
            indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third editions. We perturb the
            pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and problems?</i></dt>
        <dd>As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and problems. They
            are
            posted at the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">MIT Press
                website</a>.
            <p>We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the
                book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems,
                but by
                no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take
                somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the
                manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT Press website.) You cannot get the
                passwords
                from me or from any of my coauthors.</p>
            <b>I will not respond to requests for the manual or for solutions.</b>
        </dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>How can I typeset pseudocode to make it look like the pseudocode in the book?</i></dt>
        <dd>I created two packages for LaTeX2e. The <code>clrscode</code> package gives you pseudocode in the style of
            the second
            edition, and the <code>clrscode3e</code> package gives you pseudocode in the style of the third edition. You
            can download
            either package and its documentation by clicking <a
                href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrscode/">here</a>.
            The <code>clrscode</code> package is also on the <a
                href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/?filename=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/&preferredCTAN=tug.ctan.org&action=/tools/filesearch&catstring=macros/latex/contrib/clrscode/">CTAN
                website</a>.</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>Can you send me a free copy of the book? Can you send me an electronic copy of the book? Can you help me
                with this algorithms problem I have?</i></dt>
        <dd>No, no, and sorry, but no. You can purchase an electronic copy of the book, however: Amazon.com now sells a
            version of Introduction to Algorithms for Kindle.</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>I see that there are two versions of the second edition, one published by the MIT Press and one published
                by McGraw-Hill. How do the two versions differ?</i></dt>
        <dd>Other than minor differences in the covers, the book content in the two versions is identical. McGraw-Hill
            also includes a CD (see the next question).</dd>
        <p></p>
        <dt><i>Are the algorithms in the book implemented in a real programming language, rather than just
                pseudocode?</i></dt>
        <dd>In the second edition, McGraw-Hill included with the book a CD containing Java implementations of all the
            algorithms in Parts I-VI. The CD also has Javadoc-generated web pages that document all the classes. We did
            not update the Java implementations for the third edition. <p>For the fourth edition, we will make available
                on the MIT Press website implementations in Python by Linda Xiao and me.</p>

        removed me from the Oceanside page with the notation "Removed notable people who barely lived there or people

    <p>My wife, Nicole, and I took a <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/bbqtour/">Barbecue tour</a> of the South
        in August 1998.</p>
    <p>In July 2010, I rollerbladed the <a href="https://friendsofcdatrails.org/trail-of-the-coeur-dalenes/">Trail of
            the Coeur D'Alenes</a>, a 71.4-mile-long paved rail trail in the Idaho panhandle. Accompanied by my friend,
        Paul Daro, who also bladed, and Nicole, who biked, we went 42 miles the first day and the balance the second
        day. Here is a <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/images/Plummer.jpg">photo</a> of the three of us at
        the start of the first day, at the western trailhead in Plummer, Idaho, (on the Coeur D'Alene reservation) and

        the second day, at the eastern trailhead in Mullan, Idaho. We met <a

    <p>I was the Ice Man for the <a href="http://www.mdbbq.com/">Maryland State Barbecue Championship</a> in 2003, 2004,
        and 2005. Here's a <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/ICE.jpg">photo</a> from the 2005 contest of me
        with a quad-runner full of 40-pound bags of ice. The photo was taken by the <a
            href="http://www.dizzypigbbq.com/">Dizzy Pigs</a>, the 2005 and 2006 Grand Champions. Even with the
        megaphone, I was pretty hoarse by the end of the second day. The Dizzy Pigs, and all the other contestants, can
        explain why.</p>
    <p>I was <a href="http://www.kcbs.us/">Kansas City Barbeque Society</a> Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145. (I
        have purposely let my KCBS membership lapse.) My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011 Maryland State
